## Storybook Community Collective

The Storybook Community Collective is a group dedicated to keeping the addon ecosystem healthy, consistent, and well-maintained as Storybook evolves. We do so by publishing maintenance updates for popular addons that have not kept up with Storybook’s release cycle, and we also develop and publish our own addons! When an addon's author no longer responds to Pull Requests and cannot be reached, the Storybook Community Collective may step in to provide a maintained fork of the addon.

### How to participate

We happily welcome new contributors. To ensure the sustainability of the collective, new members are invited based on:
* Agreement with our [code of conduct](https://github.com/storybook-community/.github/blob/main/profile/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [safety procedures](https://github.com/storybook-community/.github/blob/main/profile/SAFETY.md)
* Track record of contributions to FOSS projects (NPM packages with active users, multiple contributions to larger projects)

Here are the criteria for an addon to be adopted into the community group:
* The addon has a significant user base or provides unique value to the ecosystem
* There must be a person available to be the primary maintainer

#### If you're an addon author

Do you already know how to [write Storybook addons](https://storybook.js.org/docs/addons/writing-addons)? You can join the collective as a general contributor, to help with maintenance effort when major versions of Storybook are released. Come [talk to us on Discord](https://discord.gg/KKXFQy9sFc) if you're interested in helping out.

To read more about contributing, check out our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/storybook-community/.github/blob/main/profile/CONTRIBUTE.md). If you're already a Storybook contributor or maintainer, you can participate in the maintenance of all addons in the organisation. Otherwise, we can propose specific addons that need active contributors that you can help maintain.

#### If you rely on an addon that needs updates

If an addon you depend on isn’t keeping pace with recent Storybook versions, you can help bring it under community stewardship. We’ll support you in updating it and, if needed, publishing a community-maintained version under our namespace. This avoids duplicated effort, and gives your fork more visibility.
